/**
 * FileSystemPort: the single abstraction every action runs against.
 *
 * Two implementations exist in core:
 *   - RealFileSystem: node:fs backed, used during a real install.
 *   - VirtualFileSystem: an overlay (disk snapshot + recorded mutations),
 *     used for dry-run validation. It can also "see inside" archives via the
 *     ArchiveReader port so Extract can be simulated without inflating.
 *
 * All paths handed to a port are absolute and already sandbox-checked by the
 * PathResolver. Ports never resolve placeholders. Separators are always "/"
 * inside core; the real adapter converts on Windows.
